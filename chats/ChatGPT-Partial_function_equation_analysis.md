# Partial function equation analysis

#### You:
What is if I have a set like this {x | P(x) - Q(x) =  1} where P(x) is a partial function?

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent question—it touches on some subtle points of logic and set theory.

Let’s carefully unpack your set:

$
S = \bigl\{\, x \mid P(x) - Q(x) = 1 \bigr\}
$

where $ P(x) $ is a **partial function**. 

---

## What does it mean that $ P(x) $ is partial?

- A **total function** is defined for every input $ x $ in its domain.
- A **partial function** may be **undefined** for some inputs $ x $.

So for some values of $ x $, $ P(x) $ might simply “not exist.” In other words, there’s no value for $ P(x) $ to plug into $ P(x) - Q(x) $.

---

## How does this affect your set $ S $?

Let’s consider the logical meaning of your set:

$
S = \{\, x \mid P(x) - Q(x) = 1 \,\}
$

Strictly speaking, the expression

$
P(x) - Q(x) = 1
$

**cannot be true or false** if $ P(x) $ is undefined. For example, if $ P(x) $ doesn’t exist, you cannot compute $ P(x) - Q(x) $, so there’s no truth value assigned to the statement.

Hence, **$ x $ should only be in the set if:**

1. $ P(x) $ is defined, and
2. $ P(x) - Q(x) = 1 $

Therefore, the correct way to express the set is:

$
S = \bigl\{\, x \;\big|\; P(x) \text{ is defined and } P(x) - Q(x) = 1 \bigr\}.
$

---

## Why does this matter?

If you ignore whether $ P(x) $ is defined, you risk including “undefined” values in your set or writing a set comprehension whose membership condition doesn’t always have a truth value. In mathematical logic and rigorous set theory, we usually avoid such ambiguity.

---

### Example

Suppose

- $ P(x) = \sqrt{x} $ defined only for $ x \ge 0 $
- $ Q(x) = 1 $

Then:

$
P(x) - Q(x) = \sqrt{x} - 1
$

Setting it equal to $ 1 $:

$
\sqrt{x} - 1 = 1 \implies x = 4
$

So:

- $ P(4) = 2 $
- $ Q(4) = 1 $
- $ P(4) - Q(4) = 1 $

Therefore, $ 4 \in S $.

But $ x = -1 $ cannot be in $ S $, because $ P(-1) $ is undefined.

Hence:

$
S = \{ 4 \}
$

---

## Summary

When $ P(x) $ is a partial function, your set:

$
\bigl\{\, x \mid P(x) - Q(x) = 1 \bigr\}
$

must **implicitly or explicitly restrict** $ x $ to those values where $ P(x) $ is defined. Otherwise, your set comprehension has undefined conditions.

So the safe, rigorous definition is:

$
\boxed{S = \bigl\{\, x \;\big|\; P(x) \text{ is defined and } P(x) - Q(x) = 1 \bigr\}.}
$

Let me know if you’d like to explore this in the context of specific examples or logic formalisms (e.g. partial functions in computability theory)!
