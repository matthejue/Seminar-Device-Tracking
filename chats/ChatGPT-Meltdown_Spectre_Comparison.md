# Meltdown Spectre Comparison

#### You:
Can you write me a motivation for my report about this paper that draws a comparison between Meltdow or Spectre and the method in this paper.

Use a few words as possible.

#### ChatGPT:
Here's a concise motivation for your report, drawing a parallel to Meltdown and Spectre:

**Motivation:**\
Like Meltdown and Spectre, which exploit microarchitectural side channels to extract sensitive data, this paper exposes a vulnerability in Linux’s TCP port selection that allows persistent cross-network device tracking. Both illustrate how low-level system behaviors, designed for performance or randomness, can unintentionally undermine user privacy and security.


#### You:
That should be the first what the reader reads in my report. The text should describe my method and draw a line to Meltdown or Specture, eitheer of two, the one that fits best. Please be precise in saying in what way both attacks are similar. Is it Security or Safety that is getting attacked and in which way?

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly. Here's a precise, minimal introduction that clearly presents your method and draws a strong, specific analogy to *Meltdown*:

---

**Motivation**\
This report presents a device tracking method that exploits hash collisions in Linux’s TCP source port selection, creating a persistent device ID across browsers, networks, and privacy modes. Like *Meltdown*, which breaks the isolation between processes by exploiting microarchitectural leakage, our method breaks the intended isolation between web sessions by exploiting kernel-level randomness leakage. Both attacks target **security**, not safety: they do not crash or corrupt systems but violate confidentiality by extracting information from internal state designed to remain hidden—*Meltdown* from CPU caches, our method from TCP/IP stack behavior.

---

Let me know if you want a version comparing to *Spectre* instead.


#### You:
The method is not by me, I just write a report about this method. Please mention the authors of this paper.

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you for the clarification. Here's the revised version of the motivation, incorporating the authors and clarifying your role:

---

**Motivation**\
This report analyzes a device tracking technique developed by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad, which exploits hash collisions in Linux’s TCP source port selection to create a persistent device ID across browsers, networks, and privacy modes. Similar to *Meltdown*, which extracts privileged memory via microarchitectural side channels, this method breaks cross-session and cross-network isolation by leaking kernel-level randomness. Both attacks compromise **security**, not safety: they do not disrupt system operation, but undermine confidentiality by revealing information from components—CPU caches in *Meltdown*, and TCP/IP stack behavior in this work—that were assumed to be opaque.

---

Let me know if you’d like it shortened further or adapted for a specific tone.


#### You:
Please also mention the institure where they are working.

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly. Here's the final, precise version with the authors’ affiliation included:

---

**Motivation**\
This report analyzes a device tracking technique developed by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Their method exploits hash collisions in Linux’s TCP source port selection to derive a persistent device ID that survives browser privacy modes, network changes, and VPNs. Like *Meltdown*, which leaks privileged memory through microarchitectural side channels, this technique undermines intended isolation by leaking kernel-level randomness. Both attacks target **security**—they don’t cause crashes or data loss, but breach confidentiality by exposing hidden internal state: *Meltdown* via CPU caches, and this work via the TCP/IP stack.

---

Let me know if you want a one-sentence summary version or a version tailored for a more technical or general audience.


#### You:
Write something like "the famous Meltdown exploit that caused some havoc in..." that fits best.

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly—here’s the refined version with that phrasing naturally integrated:

---

**Motivation**\
This report analyzes a device tracking technique developed by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Their method exploits hash collisions in Linux’s TCP source port selection to derive a persistent device ID that survives browser privacy modes, network changes, and VPNs. Much like the famous *Meltdown* exploit that caused widespread concern in 2018 by leaking privileged memory through microarchitectural side channels, this technique undermines isolation guarantees—here, by leaking kernel-level randomness. Both attacks target **security** rather than safety: they don’t crash systems, but compromise confidentiality by exposing hidden internal state—*Meltdown* via CPU caches, this technique via the TCP/IP stack.

---

Let me know if you'd like a version comparing it instead to *Spectre*, or with a stronger emphasis on web tracking.


#### You:
Please makee the text start with a sentence like: "Many of you may still remember the Meltdown and Specture attacks that caused quite some havoc in.." but more fitting.

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here’s a version that begins with a relatable and fitting reference to *Meltdown* and *Spectre*, while smoothly transitioning into the subject of your report:

---

**Motivation**\
Many will remember the *Meltdown* and *Spectre* attacks that caused widespread alarm in 2018 by exposing how low-level performance optimizations in CPUs could be exploited to leak sensitive data. In this report, we examine a similarly surprising vulnerability uncovered by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Their technique exploits the TCP source port selection algorithm in modern Linux kernels to generate persistent device identifiers—breaking cross-browser, cross-network, and cross-VPN privacy barriers. Like *Meltdown*, this attack targets **security**, not safety: it does not disrupt systems, but compromises confidentiality by leaking internal state—*Meltdown* through CPU caches, and this technique through the TCP/IP stack.

---

Let me know if you'd like an even shorter version or a more formal tone.


#### You:
It exploits and old version of this algorithm as the exploit has already been fixed and it the paper also included how this exploit can be fixed.

#### ChatGPT:
Thank you—here's the updated version that reflects that the vulnerability was in an older version of the algorithm and that the paper includes a fix:

---

**Motivation**\
Many will remember the *Meltdown* and *Spectre* attacks that caused widespread alarm in 2018 by revealing how low-level optimizations in CPUs could be exploited to leak sensitive data. In a similar spirit, this report reviews a now-patched vulnerability discovered by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Their work exposed how an older version of Linux’s TCP source port selection algorithm—intended to enhance security—could instead be exploited to generate persistent device identifiers across browsers, networks, and VPNs. Like *Meltdown*, the attack targets **security**, not safety: it leaves systems running, but compromises confidentiality by leaking internal state—*Meltdown* via CPU caches, this technique via TCP/IP stack behavior. The authors not only demonstrate the attack but also contributed a fix, which has since been incorporated into the Linux kernel.

---

Let me know if you want this trimmed or adapted for a specific section of your report.


#### You:
Write it more in a way: "In 2018..

#### ChatGPT:
Of course! Here’s a version beginning with “In 2018…” and integrating your clarifications:

---

**Motivation**\
In 2018, the *Meltdown* and *Spectre* attacks caused widespread concern by revealing how low-level CPU optimizations could leak sensitive data across security boundaries. In a similar vein, this report reviews research by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who discovered that an older version of Linux’s TCP source port selection algorithm—designed for security—could be exploited to create persistent device identifiers that survive browser privacy modes, network changes, and VPNs. Like *Meltdown*, this attack targets **security**, not safety: it doesn’t crash systems, but breaches confidentiality by leaking internal state—*Meltdown* through CPU caches, this technique through TCP/IP stack behavior. Importantly, the authors also proposed and contributed a fix, which has since been integrated into the Linux kernel.

Would you like it shorter, more formal, or more conversational?


#### You:
Please be more precise on what Meltdown did.

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent. Here’s a revised version that’s more precise about *Meltdown*:

---

**Motivation**\
In 2018, the *Meltdown* and *Spectre* attacks caused widespread concern by revealing how speculative execution in modern CPUs could be exploited to read sensitive data from privileged memory that should have been inaccessible to user processes. In a similar vein, this report reviews research by Moshe Kol, Amit Klein, and Yossi Gilad from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who discovered that an older version of Linux’s TCP source port selection algorithm—designed to improve security—could instead be exploited to create persistent device identifiers that survive browser privacy modes, network changes, and VPNs. Like *Meltdown*, this attack targets **security**, not safety: it does not crash systems or corrupt data, but violates confidentiality by leaking internal state—*Meltdown* through CPU caches, this technique through patterns in TCP/IP stack behavior. Notably, the authors also proposed and contributed a fix, which has since been integrated into the Linux kernel.

---

Let me know if you’d like an even tighter comparison or any stylistic changes.


#### You:
"In a similar vein, this report reviews research " sound like my report does the same, but it's the method that these guys found that does this and I write a report about that.

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent clarification—that’s an important distinction. Here’s a corrected version that makes it clear **their** method is the “similar” attack, and that **you** are merely reporting on it:

#### You:
Can you precisely mention what this internal state that is leaked in the method fromt the paper in the report text?

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely—that’s a great way to make it clearer and more precise. Here’s a revised version explicitly stating what internal state is leaked:

Like *Meltdown*, their attack targets **security**, not safety: it does not crash systems or corrupt data, but violates confidentiality by leaking internal state—*Meltdown* extracts contents from CPU caches, while this technique reveals the secret per-device key used in Linux’s TCP source port hashing, indirectly exposing a fingerprint unique to each device. This report analyzes their work, which also includes a proposed fix that has since been integrated into the Linux kernel.

---

Let me know if you’d like it shorter, or with a different level of technical detail!


#### You:
No this technique does not reveal the secret per-device key, it uses it.

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent—thank you for the correction. Let’s phrase it precisely. The attack **does not reveal** the secret key itself but **exploits collisions caused by it** to fingerprint the device. Here’s a corrected version:

#### ChatGPT:
Of course! Here’s a text suitable for your report, strictly based on pages 1–2 of the paper you uploaded, using consistent terminology as found there (e.g. “device tracking,” “browser-based tracking,” “cross-site tracking,” etc.):

---

**Web-Based Device Tracking**

Browser-based device tracking is a widespread practice employed by many Internet websites and advertisers. It allows identifying users across multiple sessions and websites on the Internet. The motivations for web-based device tracking include fraud detection, protection against account hijacking, anti-bot and anti-scraping services, enterprise security management, protection against DDoS attacks, real-time targeted marketing, campaign measurement, reaching customers across devices, and limiting the number of accesses to services.

Device tracking is often used to personalize advertisements or for surveillance purposes. It can be performed either by websites that users visit directly or by third-party companies, such as advertising networks, which track users across multiple websites and applications. This practice, known as cross-site tracking, has traditionally relied on third-party cookies. However, users are increasingly aware of the privacy risks associated with cookies and employ measures such as using multiple browsers, activating browser privacy modes, and deleting cookies to avoid being tracked. In addition, major browsers are gradually withdrawing support for third-party cookies due to privacy concerns. Consequently, trackers are seeking new technologies capable of working across sites, browsers, and privacy modes, thereby circumventing the isolation these measures are meant to provide.

One of the most significant privacy threats posed by device tracking is the ability to follow a user’s device across different networks, browsers, VPNs, and privacy modes. This enables linking a user’s identities across contexts that were intended to remain separate—for example, browsing different sites under different accounts or from different networks.

Often, device tracking techniques are used without the user’s awareness or explicit consent. This motivates research efforts to uncover how device tracking works, identify new tracking methods that can be deployed without user consent, and work with software vendors to mitigate such threats and raise awareness about emerging privacy risks.

Would you like it shorter, simpler, or written in a different style?


#### You:
Please write a shorter text.

#### ChatGPT:
Of course! Here’s a shorter version, still strictly based on pages 1–2 of the paper:

---

**Web-Based Device Tracking**

Browser-based device tracking is widely used by websites and advertisers to identify users across sessions and sites. It serves purposes such as fraud detection, account protection, targeted marketing, and limiting service access.

Traditionally, cross-site tracking relied on third-party cookies, but growing privacy concerns and technical defenses like privacy modes and cookie blocking have pushed trackers to seek new methods that work across browsers and networks.

A major privacy risk of device tracking is linking a user’s identities across different contexts—like networks, browsers, or privacy modes—without their awareness or consent. This has led researchers to study tracking methods and help develop mitigations to protect user privacy.

---

Let me know if you’d like it even shorter or differently phrased!


#### You:
Is trackinng of deviced via third party cookies not possible anymore in browsers?

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent question—and an important nuance!

Tracking devices via **third-party cookies** is still **possible in some browsers**, but it’s rapidly becoming **much less effective and widely blocked**.

Here’s the current reality (as of mid-2025):

✅ **Still possible in some contexts**

- Some browsers (especially older versions or niche ones) still allow third-party cookies by default.
- Users who don’t change privacy settings might still be tracked this way.

❌ **Becoming increasingly blocked**

- Major browsers like Safari and Firefox block third-party cookies by default.
- Google Chrome has begun phasing them out and plans a near-total deprecation.
- Many users actively block or delete cookies, or use privacy modes that isolate them.

So **third-party cookie tracking isn’t fully gone yet**, but its days are numbered, and advertisers and trackers are urgently looking for alternatives, like device fingerprinting or techniques such as the one described in the paper you’re reporting on.

Would you like me to integrate this clarification into your report text?


#### You:
Can you write me a text for my report that only uses what is written in the section Related Work on the pages 2-3 from the paper pdf I uploaded.
Please only use the information provided in the paper and call something always consistently in the same way. The text should give an overview about the different categories of device tracking. Please create me some latex code that I can cirectly paste into my document. The use of itemize or some similar environment is wanted if its fits.

#### ChatGPT:
Fantastic! Below is LaTeX text for your report, **strictly summarizing** the content from the **“Related Work”** section (pages 2–3) of the paper you uploaded. I’ve used consistent terminology exactly as in the paper (e.g. “device tracking,” “browser-based tracking,” “fingerprinting,” “tagging,” “golden image challenge,” etc.) and included an `itemize` list where it fits naturally.

Here’s the LaTeX code ready for you to paste into your document:

```latex
\section{Overview of Device Tracking Techniques}

Device tracking techniques, particularly browser-based tracking, face challenges in reliably identifying devices under changing conditions such as switching browsers, networks, or privacy modes. One important problem is the \emph{golden image challenge}, where many identical devices with the same hardware and software configuration need to be distinguished from each other.  

Device tracking techniques can be broadly categorized into the following two groups:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Tagging techniques:} These techniques insert an ID directly into the device, usually at the browser level. Examples include caching resources in the browser or storing data in mechanisms like cookies or \texttt{localStorage}. However, tagging techniques are often ineffective when users switch to privacy modes or clear stored data.
    
    \item \textbf{Fingerprinting techniques:} These techniques measure characteristics of the system or browser to distinguish devices. Examples include differences in fonts, hardware details, or system language. However, fingerprinting techniques often struggle to solve the golden image challenge, as identical devices may produce identical fingerprints.
\end{itemize}

Several specific browser-based tracking methods have been proposed or analyzed in previous research, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Techniques using the browser favicons cache to store device IDs, although these have been mitigated in browsers such as Chrome.
    \item Fingerprinting based on GPU features measured through the WebGL 2.0 API.
    \item Fingerprinting based on TLS client features and behavior.
    \item Tracking via timing deviations in GPU execution units, as in the ``Drawn Apart'' technique, which can distinguish devices with identical hardware and software, but only with limited accuracy.
    \item Tracking based on kernel data leakage in network protocol headers, such as IPv4 ID, IPv6 flow label, and UDP source ports. However, these vulnerabilities have been fixed in modern operating systems.
\end{itemize}

Despite ongoing research, no single existing technique completely overcomes all challenges, such as achieving tracking across networks and privacy modes while reliably distinguishing devices with identical configurations. This motivates the search for new browser-based tracking methods, such as the technique explored in this report.
```

Let me know if you’d like this even shorter, more detailed, or formatted differently (e.g. with subsections instead of bullet lists).


#### You:
Does the paper make a distinction between web-based and browser based Device tracking.

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent question — let’s be precise.

In the paper you uploaded, **“web-based” and “browser-based” device tracking are used essentially synonymously**. The authors mainly use the terms:

- **browser-based device tracking**
- **web-based device tracking**

…sometimes in the same paragraph, without defining them as separate concepts. For instance, on page 1 they write:

> “Online browser-based device tracking is a widespread practice, employed by many Internet websites and advertisers…”

…and then immediately say:

> “A list of motivations for web-based device tracking (fingerprinting) is listed in \[1]…”

The **“Related Work”** section continues using “browser-based tracking” and “browser-based tracking techniques” and focuses on how tracking works in the context of browsers (e.g. browser privacy modes, cross-browser tracking).

**So in this paper, there’s no explicit distinction between “web-based” and “browser-based” device tracking.** The discussion is firmly about tracking happening via web technologies in browsers.

Hence, for writing your report consistently with the paper, you can safely treat “web-based device tracking” and “browser-based device tracking” as synonyms, unless you wish to introduce your own distinction for clarity.

Would you like me to adjust your LaTeX snippet or any text to reflect one term consistently?


#### You:
Can you rewrite the text about browser-based device tracking a last time and specifcally include into the defintion that is uses browsers.

#### ChatGPT:
Of course! Here’s a concise LaTeX snippet you can paste into your report, defining **browser-based device tracking** explicitly as involving browsers, and still strictly aligned with how the paper frames it (pages 1–2):

```latex
\section{Browser-Based Device Tracking}

Browser-based device tracking is a widespread practice in which websites or advertisers identify and follow users by collecting information through the user’s web browser. This technique allows recognizing devices across multiple sessions and different websites.  

The motivations for browser-based device tracking include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fraud detection,
    \item protection against account hijacking,
    \item anti-bot and anti-scraping services,
    \item enterprise security management,
    \item protection against DDoS attacks,
    \item real-time targeted marketing,
    \item campaign measurement,
    \item reaching customers across devices, and
    \item limiting the number of accesses to services.
\end{itemize}

Traditionally, cross-site tracking relied on third-party cookies. However, due to growing privacy concerns and technical countermeasures such as browser privacy modes and cookie blocking, trackers are now searching for new methods that still work across different browsers and networks.  

A significant privacy risk of browser-based device tracking is its ability to link a user’s activities across different networks, browsers, VPNs, and privacy modes, potentially connecting separate identities that the user intended to keep apart. Often, such tracking is performed without the user’s knowledge or explicit consent, motivating research into uncovering these methods and developing protections against them.
```

This text makes it crystal-clear that browser-based tracking **depends on the browser**. Let me know if you’d prefer it shorter or simpler!


#### You:
Can you still include the "to identify users across sessions and sites" aspect?

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely! Here’s a revised LaTeX snippet for your report that explicitly includes **browser use** and the goal of identifying users **across sessions and sites**, fully consistent with the paper’s wording (pages 1–2):

```latex
\section{Browser-Based Device Tracking}

Browser-based device tracking is a widespread practice in which websites or advertisers use information collected through the user’s web browser to identify devices across sessions and different websites. This technique enables recognizing and linking a user’s activities even when they revisit sites at different times or access multiple sites.  

The motivations for browser-based device tracking include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item fraud detection,
    \item protection against account hijacking,
    \item anti-bot and anti-scraping services,
    \item enterprise security management,
    \item protection against DDoS attacks,
    \item real-time targeted marketing,
    \item campaign measurement,
    \item reaching customers across devices, and

#### You:
Can you tell me why the “golden image” challenge is called this way?

#### ChatGPT:
Great question—this is a term you’ll often see in security papers, and it helps to know where it comes from.

The **“golden image”** refers to the **standardized, master copy** of a system configuration—like a clean, fully configured disk image—that organizations use to **provision many identical devices** (laptops, virtual machines, phones, etc.).

So why “golden”?

- In IT and deployment workflows, a “golden image” (sometimes called a “gold master”) is the **trusted reference image** that is cloned over and over.
- All devices built from this image have **the same software, same configuration, same libraries, same settings**, and often identical hardware too.

This creates a **challenge for device tracking and fingerprinting**, because:

- Traditional fingerprinting methods rely on small differences (fonts installed, OS version, hardware variations).
- But when all devices are clones of the same “golden image,” those differences disappear.

So the **“golden image challenge”** means:

> How can you still distinguish and track individual devices when they all look exactly the same because they were deployed from the same reference image?

The term comes directly from IT practices and was adopted in tracking and fingerprinting research to describe this problem.

If you want, I can help you write a precise definition for your report!


#### You:
Can you telll me what  localStorage is that is mentioned in the paper?

#### ChatGPT:
Absolutely! Let’s clarify what **localStorage** means, especially in the context of browser-based tracking, as in your paper.

✅ **What is localStorage?**

- **localStorage** is part of the **Web Storage API** in modern web browsers.
- It lets websites store small amounts of data (typically up to around 5–10 MB per domain) **directly in the browser**.
- Unlike cookies, localStorage data:
  - **Persists across browser sessions** — even after the browser is closed and reopened.
  - Is **not automatically sent to the server** with every HTTP request (unlike cookies).
  - Is specific to the protocol, domain, and port of the page that saved it.

✅ **Why is it used for tracking?**

- Websites can save a unique identifier (like a user or device ID) in localStorage.
- This ID stays there until the user clears their browser storage manually.
- Even if users delete cookies, localStorage data might remain, allowing trackers to “respawn” deleted cookies or link sessions together.

Example:

```js
// Store data
localStorage.setItem("deviceID", "abc123");

// Retrieve data
let id = localStorage.getItem("deviceID");
console.log(id); // prints "abc123"
```

In your paper, **tagging techniques** refer to storing tracking IDs in things like localStorage, because it’s another place where persistent data can be hidden in the browser to track users.

Can you write me a text for my report that only uses what is written in the section Background on the pages 3-4 from the paper pdf I uploaded.
Please only use the information provided in the paper and call something always consistently in the same way. Please create me some latex code that I can cirectly paste into my document. The use of itemize or some similar environment is wanted if its fits.
The text should say what the goals of Source Port Selection are and why and in connection with what it is needed and how it works in practise.

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent! Below is LaTeX text suitable for your report, strictly summarizing the **Background** section from pages 3–4 of the paper you uploaded. I’ve kept the terminology consistent with the paper (e.g. “source port selection,” “4-tuple,” “DHPS,” etc.). I’ve also used an `itemize` list to explain the goals.

Here’s LaTeX code you can directly paste into your document:

```latex
\section{Background on Source Port Selection}

Source port selection is a mechanism used by the TCP/IP stack of operating systems to choose a TCP source port number for outbound TCP connections. It is required because a TCP connection between two endpoints is uniquely identified by the \emph{4-tuple}, consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the source IP address,
    \item the source port,
    \item the destination IP address, and
    \item the destination port.
\end{itemize}

Thus, selecting a unique and appropriate source port is necessary to establish new TCP connections without conflicts.  

According to the paper, source port selection has two main goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minimizing predictability of the ephemeral port numbers}, to improve security against blind TCP attacks such as reset or data injection attacks.
    \item \textbf{Minimizing collisions of instance-IDs}, to ensure that successive connections do not reuse the same 4-tuple, which could cause connection failures because previous connections might still be active on the server side (e.g., in the TCP TIME\_WAIT state).
\end{itemize}

To address these goals, several algorithms for TCP source port selection have been defined, including the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm, abbreviated as DHPS, described in RFC 6056. The Linux kernel adopted DHPS starting from version 5.12-rc1, citing security and privacy improvements. DHPS generates TCP source ports for outbound TCP connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.  

DHPS uses cryptographic hash functions to calculate port numbers. It first computes an offset and a table index based on a cryptographic keyed-hash of the connection’s 3-tuple (the source IP, destination IP, and destination port). The algorithm attempts to allocate a port number based on these values and checks if the candidate port is suitable. If the port is already in use, the algorithm increments the candidate port and tries again until a suitable port is found or no ports remain available.  

Overall, source port selection is crucial for securely and reliably establishing TCP connections without port conflicts and for defending against certain network attacks.

#### You:
Can you include into the text why this whole concept of a ports was needed in the first place and why one needs special source port selection algorithms insated of just choosing the next free port?

#### ChatGPT:
Fantastic — that’s a key piece of context. Let’s add precisely what the paper says about why source ports exist and why simple sequential allocation is not enough.

Below is LaTeX text for your report, strictly based on the **Background** section (pages 3–4) of the paper you uploaded, and expanded to include:

- why ports exist,
- why choosing just the next free port is not sufficient,
- consistent terminology as in the paper.

Here’s LaTeX code ready for your document:

\section{Background on Source Port Selection}

Source port selection is a mechanism used by the TCP/IP stack of operating systems to choose a TCP source port number for outbound TCP connections. It is needed because a TCP connection between two endpoints is uniquely identified by the \emph{4-tuple}, consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the source IP address,
    \item the source port,
    \item the destination IP address, and
    \item the destination port.
\end{itemize}

Ports exist to enable multiple simultaneous network connections on the same device, even to the same destination IP address and destination port. For example, a single machine may need to establish several independent TCP connections to the same remote server. Using different source ports allows the operating system to distinguish between these separate connections.  

A straightforward way to select source ports might be simply choosing the next free port in sequence. However, the paper explains that this approach is insufficient for two main reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security against blind TCP attacks:} Predictable source port numbers make it easier for attackers to carry out off-path attacks such as blind reset or data injection attacks, which can disrupt or hijack TCP connections.
    \item \textbf{Avoiding collisions of instance-IDs:} Reusing the same source port too quickly for new connections can cause failures because servers may still keep previous connections alive in states like TIME\_WAIT. Using the same 4-tuple again too soon can result in errors or dropped connections.
\end{itemize}

To address these issues, several algorithms for TCP source port selection have been defined. One of these is the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm, abbreviated DHPS, described in RFC 6056. The Linux kernel adopted DHPS starting from version 5.12-rc1, citing security and privacy improvements. DHPS generates TCP source ports for outbound TCP connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.  

DHPS works by computing an offset and a table index based on cryptographic keyed-hash functions using the connection’s 3-tuple (the source IP, destination IP, and destination port). It then attempts to allocate a port number using these values. If the candidate port is already in use, the algorithm increments the candidate port and tries again until it finds a suitable one or exhausts available ports.  

Thus, source port selection is essential for securely and reliably establishing TCP connections, avoiding conflicts, and defending against certain network attacks.
```

This explanation stays strictly within the content from the paper but expands on the practical reasons why ports exist and why simple allocation is insecure or insufficient, as the paper discusses. Let me know if you’d like it shorter, simpler, or even more technical!


#### You:
Please write more like: "A straightforward way would be, but..."

#### ChatGPT:
Excellent! Let’s phrase it in a style closer to how you’d naturally write an explanation:

Below is LaTeX code for your report, still strictly using content and concepts from pages 3–4 of the paper, but with your requested tone (“A straightforward way would be, but…”).

```latex
\section{Background on Source Port Selection}

Source port selection is a mechanism used by the TCP/IP stack of operating systems to choose a TCP source port number for outbound TCP connections. It is necessary because a TCP connection between two endpoints is uniquely identified by the \emph{4-tuple}, consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the source IP address,
    \item the source port,
    \item the destination IP address, and
    \item the destination port.
\end{itemize}

Ports are needed so that multiple simultaneous network connections can coexist on the same device, even to the same destination IP address and destination port. For example, a single machine might want to establish several independent TCP connections to the same remote server, and different source ports allow the operating system to distinguish these connections.  

A straightforward way to select source ports would be simply to pick the next available free port in sequence. However, as the paper explains, this approach has significant drawbacks. Firstly, it makes source port numbers predictable, which poses a security risk because attackers can exploit predictable ports to carry out off-path attacks such as blind resets or data injection attacks. Secondly, sequential reuse of ports can cause functional problems because a previously closed connection might still be lingering on the server side in a state like TIME\_WAIT. If the same 4-tuple is used too quickly again, it can lead to connection failures.

To address these issues, several algorithms for TCP source port selection have been proposed. One of these is the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm, abbreviated DHPS, described in RFC 6056. The Linux kernel adopted DHPS starting from version 5.12-rc1, citing security and privacy improvements. DHPS generates TCP source ports for outbound TCP connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.  

DHPS operates by calculating an offset and a table index using cryptographic keyed-hash functions based on the connection’s 3-tuple (the source IP, destination IP, and destination port). It then tries to allocate a port number based on these values. If the candidate port is already in use, the algorithm increments the port number and attempts again until it finds a suitable one or no ports remain.  

In summary, source port selection plays a crucial role in ensuring secure and reliable TCP connections, preventing conflicts, and defending against certain network attacks.

This preserves the details from the paper while flowing naturally with the “A straightforward way would be, but…” structure. Let me know if you’d like it shorter, even more explanatory, or more concise!


#### You:
Please list the goals descripted in the paper in an itemize environment. And wirte it more in a way like "A straightforward way would be..., but" and summarize the goals maybe in a single word. And later say that the paper describes two goals.

A straightforward way to select source ports would be simply to choose the next available free port in sequence. But this approach is problematic because it fails to achieve two important goals described in the paper:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Security:} Predictable source port numbers make it easier for attackers to perform off-path attacks, such as blind reset or data injection attacks, by guessing the details of active TCP connections.
    \item \textbf{Functionality:} Quickly reusing the same source port can cause failures because earlier connections might still be active or in the TIME\_WAIT state on the server side. Reusing the same 4-tuple too soon can lead to errors or dropped connections.
\end{itemize}

To address these goals, several algorithms for TCP source port selection have been proposed. One of these is the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm, abbreviated DHPS, described in RFC 6056.

- uses “A straightforward way would be, but…”
- summarizes the goals as “Security” and “Functionality”
- lists the goals in an `itemize` block
- stays faithful to the text and terminology of the paper.

\section{Double-Hash Port Selection Algorithm}

The Linux kernel adopted DHPS starting from version 5.12-rc1, citing security and privacy improvements. DHPS generates TCP source ports for outbound TCP connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.

DHPS selects a TCP source port for a given \emph{3-tuple}, consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the source IP address,
    \item the destination IP address, and
    \item the destination port.
\end{itemize}

This process completes the connection’s \emph{4-tuple} by assigning the source port. DHPS uses two cryptographic keyed-hash functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ F $, which maps its inputs to a large range of integers,
    \item $ G $, which maps its inputs to a range corresponding to the size of a \emph{perturbation table}.
\end{itemize}

DHPS operates as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It calculates an \emph{offset} by applying the hash function $ F $ to the 3-tuple.
    \item It calculates an \emph{index} into the perturbation table by applying the hash function $ G $ to the 3-tuple.
    \item It retrieves a counter value from the perturbation table at the calculated index.
    \item It computes a candidate port number using:
    $
        \text{port} = \text{min\_ephemeral} + ((\text{offset} + \text{counter}) \bmod \text{num\_ephemeral})
    $
    where \texttt{min\_ephemeral} and \texttt{num\_ephemeral} define the allowed range of ephemeral ports.
    \item It checks whether the candidate port is suitable. If it is already in use or otherwise unsuitable, the algorithm increments the candidate port and repeats the check until a free port is found or no ports remain.
\end{itemize}

DHPS provides a trade-off between security and functionality, ensuring that ephemeral ports are chosen in a way that is both unpredictable to attackers and avoids collisions in TCP connections. Because Android uses the Linux kernel, DHPS also affects Android devices that adopt kernel versions where DHPS is implemented.

The Linux kernel adopted DHPS starting from version 5.12-rc1, citing security and privacy improvements. DHPS generates TCP source ports for outbound TCP connections over both IPv4 and IPv6.

TCP source ports are divided into different ranges, each serving distinct purposes. One important category is the \emph{ephemeral ports}, which are short-lived ports dynamically chosen by the operating system when a client initiates an outbound connection. This separation exists because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower-numbered ports, often called \emph{well-known ports} (typically ports 0–1023), are reserved for specific services such as HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).
    \item \emph{Registered ports} (typically ports 1024–49151) are assigned to user applications or services but are not considered ephemeral.
    \item \emph{Ephemeral ports} (typically in the higher range, e.g. 32768–60999 in Linux) are reserved for temporary client-side connections, ensuring that applications can dynamically and safely open multiple simultaneous connections without conflicting with well-known or registered services.

    \item It retrieves an \emph{entry} from the perturbation table at the calculated index.
    \item It computes a candidate port number using:
    $
        \text{port} = \text{min\_ephemeral} + ((\text{offset} + \text{entry}) \bmod \text{num\_ephemeral})
    $
    where \texttt{min\_ephemeral} and \texttt{num\_ephemeral} define the allowed range of ephemeral ports.
    \item It checks whether the candidate port is suitable. If the port is already in use or otherwise unsuitable, the algorithm increments the \emph{entry} in the perturbation table at the calculated index. As a consequence, the next time this same table entry is used, the computed port number is also incremented—unless the port is already at the end of the ephemeral range, in which case it wraps around to the beginning of the range. This process repeats until a free port is found or no ports remain.
\end{itemize}

DHPS provides a trade-off between security and functionality, ensuring that ephemeral ports are chosen in a way that is both unpredictable to attackers and avoids collisions in TCP connections. Because Android uses the Linux kernel, DHPS also affects Android devices that adopt kernel versions where DHPS is implemented.
```

✅ This version:

- Correctly distinguishes that it’s the **entry** being incremented.
- Clarifies that port incrementation is a **consequence** of changing the entry.
- Reflects wrapping at the ephemeral range edges.
- Remains strictly faithful to the paper’s explanation.

Fantastic! Let’s craft a LaTeX section strictly summarizing the **Countermeasures** section (page 14) from your uploaded paper, using consistent terminology and describing both the high-level ideas and what concretely was changed in the Linux kernel.

Below is LaTeX code you can **directly paste into your report**:

```latex
\section{Countermeasures}

The root cause that allows the attack described in the paper is that the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm (DHPS) generates port values in a deterministic manner, depending on a keyed hash of the connection’s 3-tuple and on a limited-size perturbation table. This deterministic behavior allows an attacker to probe and discover collisions in port allocation, ultimately revealing a stable device-specific pattern that can be used for tracking.

In general, to avoid or mitigate this attack, countermeasures should aim to make the source port selection less deterministic and more resistant to observation and collision analysis. The paper discusses three countermeasures that change different aspects of the Linux kernel to achieve this goal:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increase the table size $T$:}  
    A larger perturbation table makes it more difficult for an attacker to fully probe and learn the mapping between 3-tuples and allocated ports. Concretely, the Linux kernel increased the perturbation table size from 16 entries to 256 entries, thereby significantly raising the cost for an attacker to explore the entire table and find collisions.

    \item \textbf{Periodic re-keying:}  
    Changing the secret key used in DHPS periodically prevents attackers from relying on previously learned collisions, as the mapping from 3-tuples to port numbers changes with each new key. The Linux kernel implemented periodic re-keying of DHPS’s secret key every 10 minutes, limiting the time window in which collected information remains useful for tracking.

    \item \textbf{Introduce more noise:}  
    Introducing randomness into port selection increases uncertainty for attackers attempting to infer patterns. Specifically, the Linux kernel added random increments to the entries in the perturbation table. This means that even repeated connections with the same 3-tuple may result in different port allocations over time, making it more difficult to fingerprint a device reliably.
\end{itemize}

Together, these changes were integrated into Linux kernel versions 5.18 and 5.19, effectively mitigating the attack by making the source port selection process less deterministic and more resistant to tracking techniques.

\section{Countermeasures}

The root cause of the attack described in the paper is the ability of an attacker to detect hash collisions in the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm (DHPS) by probing shared entries in the perturbation table. This deterministic behavior allows the attacker to identify stable patterns in TCP source port allocation, which can be used to track a device across networks and privacy boundaries.

In general, countermeasures to prevent this attack focus on making hash collisions less likely or making their detection much more difficult. The paper proposes several modifications to DHPS, and these were incorporated into the Linux kernel through a security patch. The main countermeasures are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increase the table size $T$:}  
    By using a larger perturbation table, hash collisions become much less frequent. For example, instead of $T = 256$, a table size of $T = 256K = 262{,}144$ entries could be used, which would require 0.5 MB of RAM assuming each entry is 16 bits. This would increase the time needed for the attack by a factor of 1024 because the attacker would have to probe a much larger number of table entries. Concretely, the Linux kernel patch increased the table size to $T = 64K$, making the attack significantly harder.

    \item \textbf{Periodic re-keying:}  
    Changing the secret key used in DHPS periodically ensures that any collision information previously learned by an attacker becomes useless, as the mapping of 3-tuples to perturbation table entries and port offsets changes. The trade-off is that the same source port might be chosen again for the same 3-tuple, potentially causing connection failures if the previous connection is still active. To balance security and functionality, the Linux kernel patch implemented periodic re-keying every 10 seconds.

    \item \textbf{Introduce more noise:}  
    Adding randomness to the increments of perturbation table entries makes it harder for an attacker to detect collisions reliably. Instead of incrementing table entries deterministically, the Linux kernel patch modified DHPS so that each increment is chosen uniformly at random between 1 and 8. This introduces variability in port allocations, making tracking based on observed patterns much less accurate.
\end{itemize}

These countermeasures were integrated into Linux kernel versions 5.18 and 5.19, effectively mitigating the attack by making the source port selection process significantly less deterministic and reducing the feasibility of device tracking based on DHPS.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increase the table size $T$:}  
    Using a larger perturbation table reduces the likelihood of hash collisions because more distinct table entries are available for mapping different 3-tuples. For example, increasing $T$ from 256 to 256K would require 0.5 MB of RAM (assuming 16 bits per entry) and would make the attack approximately 1024 times more time-consuming, since the attacker would have to probe far more table entries.

    \textit{Linux Kernel Changes:}  
    In the patch issued for Linux, the perturbation table size was increased to $T = 64K$, significantly raising the attacker’s effort required to explore the table and discover collisions.

    \item \textbf{Periodic re-keying:}  
    Periodically changing the secret key used in DHPS causes the computed table index and the port offset to change, rendering any collision information learned by an attacker obsolete. However, re-keying too often could lead to reusing source ports for the same 3-tuple, potentially preventing new TCP connections if previous ones are still active. Therefore, the frequency of re-keying must balance security and connectivity.

    \textit{Linux Kernel Changes:}  
    In the Linux kernel patch, periodic re-keying was implemented to occur every 10 seconds, providing a practical balance between reducing tracking risk and maintaining network functionality.

    \item \textbf{Introduce more noise:}  
    Adding randomness to how entries in the perturbation table are incremented makes it much harder for an attacker to reliably detect collisions. Instead of always incrementing table entries by one, the algorithm introduces variability by choosing increments randomly.

    \textit{Linux Kernel Changes:}

#### You:
Also mention that ideal solution and say why it's not possible

Excellent! Let’s integrate the **ideal solution** that the paper mentions—having a private perturbation table per network namespace or interface—and also explain why it’s not practical, as stated in the paper.

\section{Countermeasures}

The root cause of the attack described in the paper is the ability of an attacker to detect hash collisions in the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm (DHPS) by probing shared entries in the perturbation table. This deterministic behavior allows the attacker to identify stable patterns in TCP source port allocation, which can be used to track a device across networks and privacy boundaries.

The ideal solution proposed in the paper would be to create a private perturbation table instance for each network namespace and interface. This would prevent an attacker from observing stable hash collisions via loopback connections because each table would be isolated. However, this solution is not practical, as it would lead to high memory consumption in environments with many containers or many network interfaces.

In general, countermeasures to prevent this attack focus on making hash collisions less frequent or making it much more difficult for attackers to detect them.

\section{Device Tracking Based on DHPS}

The paper presents a technique for device tracking that exploits the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm (DHPS), which is used in modern Linux kernels, including those running on Android devices. The attack enables tracking a device across different networks, browsers, privacy modes, containers, and VPNs. Unlike many previous tracking techniques, it works even when users attempt to isolate their browsing identities by changing networks or using privacy features.

The attack uses only legitimate web technologies and does not require elevated permissions in the browser or operating system. It is purely based on measuring TCP source ports allocated by the Linux kernel when connections are made to external servers. DHPS generates TCP source ports deterministically based on a keyed hash of the connection’s \emph{3-tuple} (source IP, destination IP, and destination port) and an entry from a global perturbation table. As a result, repeated connections from the same device using the same 3-tuple can produce consistent source port patterns that act as a fingerprint for that device.

The attack algorithm relies on several key assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The victim’s device uses a Linux kernel that implements DHPS.
    \item The attacker can induce the victim’s browser to make many TCP connections to attacker-controlled servers.
    \item The attacker can observe the TCP source ports chosen for these connections.
    \item The victim’s device does not change its kernel secret key during the attack period.
\end{itemize}

The technique works across networks because the secret key used in DHPS is generated once at system startup and remains constant until the system is rebooted. Therefore, even if a device changes its network connection or obtains a new IP address, the source ports derived from DHPS remain consistent for identical 3-tuples. This makes it possible to link activity across networks.

Similarly, the attack works across browsers because

\section{Device Tracking Based on DHPS}

The paper presents a device tracking technique that exploits the \emph{Double-Hash Port Selection} algorithm (DHPS), used in modern Linux kernels, including those running on Android devices. The technique enables tracking a device across different networks, browsers, privacy modes, VPNs, and even Linux containers. It works by exploiting deterministic behavior in DHPS, which generates TCP source ports based on cryptographic hashing of the connection’s \emph{3-tuple} (source IP, destination IP, destination port) and entries in a global perturbation table. The resulting device ID can provide up to 128 bits of entropy in the Linux implementation and persists until the device is restarted.

Unlike many traditional tracking methods that rely on browser-specific data like cookies, this attack uses only standard web technologies and measures kernel-level network behavior, making it robust across browsers, networks, and privacy protections. The technique requires the victim's browser to load a web page containing a small tracking snippet written in HTML and JavaScript. This snippet causes the browser to initiate TCP connections both to the attacker's server and to specific loopback addresses. By observing the source ports chosen for these connections, the attacker can detect hash collisions in the DHPS algorithm and thereby derive a unique device ID.

The attack algorithm relies on several assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The victim’s device runs a Linux-based operating system that uses DHPS.
    \item The attacker can induce the victim’s browser to load a tracking web page and initiate many TCP connections.
    \item The attacker can observe the TCP source ports assigned to these connections.
    \item The device’s kernel secret key remains unchanged during the attack session.
\end{itemize}

The attack works across different networks because DHPS uses a secret key that remains constant between reboots. Therefore, even if the device changes its network or obtains a new IP address, the same device ID can still be generated for identical 3-tuples. It also works across browsers because the tracking is performed at the network layer and does not depend on browser-specific storage or identifiers.

However, the technique has certain limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is ineffective if the client uses Tor or a forward proxy, since these terminate the original TCP connections and establish new ones with the tracking server.
    \item Middleboxes, such as NAT devices, that modify source ports or throttle traffic can disrupt the attack, although this interference is less common in IPv6 networks.
    \item Organic TCP connections initiated by the device during the attack can interfere with the measurements, although the technique includes mechanisms to mitigate this effect.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the tracking method demonstrates how low-level networking behaviors can be exploited to create persistent device identifiers, bypassing traditional privacy protections implemented at the browser level.

A key challenge in the attack is that the victim’s device operates essentially as a \emph{black box}. The tracking snippet executes on the victim’s browser but has no direct visibility into the device’s internal state or DHPS’s computations. The only way the attacker can gather information is indirectly, by analyzing the source port numbers observed in TCP SYN packets sent from the victim’s device. Therefore, the attack constructs the device ID by detecting and correlating hash collisions based solely on these externally visible port numbers.

The attack algorithm relies on several assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The victim’s device runs a Linux-based operating system that uses DHPS.
    \item The attacker can induce the victim’s browser to load a tracking web page and initiate many TCP connections.
    \item The attacker can observe the TCP source ports assigned to these connections.
    \item The device’s kernel secret key remains unchanged during the attack session.
\end{itemize}

The attack works across different networks because DHPS uses a secret key that remains constant between reboots. Therefore, even if the device changes its network or obtains a new IP address, the same device ID can still be generated for identical 3-tuples. It also works across browsers because the tracking is performed at the network layer and does not depend on browser-specific storage or identifiers.

However, the technique has certain limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is ineffective if the client uses Tor or a forward proxy, since these terminate the original TCP connections and establish new ones with the tracking server.
    \item Middleboxes, such as NAT devices, that modify source ports or throttle traffic can disrupt the attack, although this interference is less common in IPv6 networks.
    \item Organic TCP connections initiated by the device during the attack can interfere with the measurements, although the technique includes mechanisms to mitigate this effect.
\end{itemize}

Overall, the tracking method demonstrates how low-level networking behaviors can be exploited to create persistent device identifiers, bypassing traditional privacy protections implemented at the browser level.

✅ This version:

- Explicitly mentions that the attack uses hash collisions to construct a device ID.
- Describes why the device is treated as a black box.
- Emphasizes that the attack relies only on observations of TCP SYN packets.
- Faithfully reflects the sections you specified.

Would you like it shorter, more technical, or simpler?

Can you write me a text for my report that only uses the information in the pdf pages that I uploaded.
Please only use the information provided on the pdf pages and call something always consistently in the same way. Please create me some latex code that I can directly paste into my document. The use of itemize or some similar environment is wanted if it fits. Please replace unicode symbols by fitting latex math symbols.
The text should mention the most important basic details about the attack like:
- the attack has to work indirectly over 2 phases, because the code executed in the browser from a website has only limieted access. The attacking device is basically a black box with TCP-Syn packets as output which allow to read out the source ports.
- we have here a similar problem like in a particle accelerator, one cannot directly see the collisions of loopback 3-tuples in the perturbation table out of which one generates the the device id like one can also not directly see the particles that are colliding in a particle accelerator. But one can see the effects of those collisions as the source port for a attacker 3-tuple changes in a predicatable way if a loopback 3-tuple collides with it in the the same perturbation table cell. One can read those source ports out from TCP-Syn Packets. 
- the attack abuses hash collisions to construct a device id from patterns of these hash colisions by collecting enoguh of these hash collisions. 
- Include the followign line from one of the pdfs: GK2(IPSRC = 127.0.0.1,IPDST = 127.1.2.3,PORTDST = x) = GK2(IPSRC = 127.0.0.1,IPDST = 127.1.2.3,PORTDST = y) and explain it. 
- Explain how exactly the device id looks like using the followign line from the pfds:  {(xi,yi)} and this line from the pdfs:  (x1,x2),...,(x1,xk) and say what x1, x2  etc. are
- the device id can be construct accross networks and is only not able to persist restarts, because the key gets generated on startup of linux and are used for everything from there on
- these hash colisions can only be made visiable by reading those source ports from the Syn packets and analyse how those change in a predictable way as the DHPS algorithm is predictable at the following line of the code: tableindex ←tableindex +1 because it increments a table entry in a 
predictable way which is used by the attack algorithm.
- the diffent roles of the attack 3-tuples and the loopback 3-tuples and which are actually used for the device id
